# Drum-Kit
The Drum Kit is an interactive front-end web development project created using HTML and CSS that brings the joy of drumming to your keyboard. The web page features a visually appealing design with a clear layout and a vibrant header labeled "Drum ü•Å Kit" to set the mood. It includes a set of buttons labeled with specific alphabets (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`), each representing a unique drum sound. By tapping these keys on the keyboard or clicking the buttons, users can produce different sounds, making it a fun and engaging experience. The project utilizes HTML for the structure and CSS to style the buttons and text, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. 

Its minimalistic yet lively design, the Drum Kit not only demonstrates the power of front-end development but also provides a hands-on, interactive experience for users to explore the joy of rhythm and music.
